<h1>Welcome Gamer!</h1>

<p class="note">
Hello and welcome to Gamers Anonymous, where we help change people and their gaming life styles. Gaming at an addictive level has a negative effect on your life and lifestyle. You start eating unhealthy, stop doing homework, ruin your sleep schedule and become very unmotivated for anything. These are just the first symptomes of being a gamer, If your at the early stage of gaming you can easily recover but if your deeper into the addiction then alot must be done. <sub>(Refer to Stage panel)</sub>
</p>

<h2>Game Addiction Problem </h2>
<p>As technology advances, games get more and more realistic but with this comes people who become attach to the world of the game. This false reality is a trap and once you get caught in it, you could change your life drastically.</p>

<h2>The Impact on Society </h2>
<p>The more people that become addictive, the more the game advances and becomes bigger, better and realer which puts you deeper and deeper into the addiction. Game addiction takes you out of society and puts you into a world where you would rather be which consumes your personality and everything about you. You go from having fun at the movies or at a party on a Friday night to sitting on the computer crotched over with headsets talking to people you've never met having a e-relationship and raiding a boss in the dungeon of Azeroth. This change makes your real life friends angry that your spending so much time on the computer and your ignoring thier call and msn messages. You start to gain weight become of the lack of exersize and you either start failing in school because your not focusing or drop out because you rather be online. These things have negative impact on our society because it &quot;dumbs&quot; us down and if half of our population is at home playing a video game, the worlds obesity rate will increase, employment will decrease and depression will be a major issue because when they finallly realize that they ruined thier life with the game, its too late. They already lost everything. </p>
<h2>Inspiring Quote</h2>								
<blockquote>							
<p>					
<em>
"A couple years ago I was horribly addictive to World Of Warcraft that it started to control my life. It started from playing after 9:00 pm just to get a couple levels to scheduled raids at 7:00 pm till 1:00 am. I used to play an hour a day, then it got to the point where I skipped school and played from 10:00 am to 2:00 am. I was putting in over 60 hours of gaming a week and knew I had to change, I focused on getting my life back on track and in 2 months I was gamer free. I created an action plan that change my life and can change yours.  "
