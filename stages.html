<h1>Stages</h1>


<p class="note">&nbsp;
Game Addiction stages can be categorized into three stages -- early stage, middle stage and end stage or late stage. Game Addiction stages generally take months to develop. Gaming Addiction is a disease where the need to game interferes with physical or mental health, and negatively impacts social, family or occupational responsibilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing more then 1-2 hours a day for healthy teen and healthy women are generally considered acceptable consumption. However, as the amount or frequency of gaming increases, the earliest of the game addiciton stages can develop as a result.  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>Early Stages of Game Addiction</b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the early aming addiction stages, a person begins to depend on gaming to affect their mood. They play for relief from problems, and they begin thinking more and more about games. The person and others around them may not recognize that they are in the earliest of the stages of addiction. A gradual increase in gaming happens, meaning, it takes increasing amounts of time out of thier life. Often, the person can game for hours without sleep, food and social interaction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>Middle Addiction Stages</b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The need and desire to game gradually becomes more intense. The gamer is losing control to the game, and the mind is losing its ability to interest in anything else. Their bodies tolerance decreases as they become adjusted to the lack of sleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The person may now secretly recognize there is a gaming problem, and others have to notice as well. Typically, the gamer denies to themselves and others that thier gaming is a problem so they won't have to deal with their inner turmoil. Loss of friends, lack of employment, over-weight, and no relationships have been created at this point
	 <br/>
	 <br/>
<b>End Stage Game Addiction</b>
	 <br/>
	 <br/>
  
  As gaming progresses, the gamer has become obsessed with the game to the exclusion of nearly everything else. Everyone can tell there's a major problem. During the late game addiction stages, the mental and physical health of the gamer are seriously negatively effected. Relationships at home or socially may have been severely damaged, and the lack of education will seriously effect the gamers future as he will not get accepted into any post-secondary schools or jobs. </p>
